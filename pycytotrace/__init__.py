"""pycytotrace — pure-Python port of CytoTRACE (Gulati et al. *Science* 2020).

Predicts single-cell differentiation state from scRNA-seq counts using:
1. Sequencing-depth + Census normalisation
2. Gene Counts Signature (GCS) — mean of top 200 genes correlated with gene counts
3. NNLS regression of GCS onto cell-cell similarity matrix
4. Iterative diffusion smoothing
5. Rank-normalised → CytoTRACE score in [0,1] (1 = most stem-like, 0 = most differentiated)

v0.1 covers the core algorithm + ggplot2-python visualisation.
Batch correction (ComBat) and ``iCytoTRACE`` integration deferred to v0.2.
